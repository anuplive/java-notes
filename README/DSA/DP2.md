# Longest Common Subsequence

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - String Matching

## Description:
Find the length of the longest subsequence common to two strings. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Input:
* Two strings, text1 and text2

### Output:
* An integer representing the length of the longest common subsequence

### Examples:
* Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"  
  Output: 3  
  Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" with length 3.

* Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"  
  Output: 3  
  Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" with length 3.

* Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"  
  Output: 0  
  Explanation: There is no common subsequence between the two strings.

```

## Time Complexity:
* O(2^(m+n)) - Where m and n are the lengths of the two input strings. This is because there are two recursive calls in the worst case at each step, leading to exponential complexity.

## Space Complexity:
* O(m+n) - The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which is at most m+n.

## Algorithm:
* Base case: If either string is empty, return 0
* If the last characters of both strings match:
  * Include this character in LCS and recursively find LCS of the remaining strings
* If the last characters don't match:
  * Recursively find LCS by either:
    * Excluding the last character of the first string, or
    * Excluding the last character of the second string
  * Take the maximum of these two results
* Return the final LCS length

# Longest Palindromic Substring

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - String Manipulation

## Description:
Find the longest substring in a string that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

### Input:
* A string s

### Output:
* The longest palindromic substring of s

### Examples:
* Input: s = "babad"  
  Output: "bab" or "aba"  
  Explanation: Both "bab" and "aba" are valid palindromic substrings of maximum length 3.

* Input: s = "cbbd"  
  Output: "bb"  
  Explanation: "bb" is the longest palindromic substring with length 2.

* Input: s = "a"  
  Output: "a"  
  Explanation: A single character is always a palindrome.

        System.out.println("\nInput: " + s4);
        System.out.println("Output: " + longestPalindrome(s4));  // Expected: "racecar"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
* O(nÂ²) - Where n is the length of the input string. For each of the n characters, we expand outwards potentially up to the entire string length.

## Space Complexity:
* O(n) - The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack depth, which in the worst case can be n/2 (for a string that is a palindrome).

## Algorithm:
* For each character in the string:
  * Consider it as the center of an odd-length palindrome
  * Consider it and its next character as the center of an even-length palindrome
* For each center position, expand outwards recursively as long as characters match
* Update the longest palindrome found whenever we find a longer one
* Return the substring corresponding to the longest palindrome found

# Wildcard Matching

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - String Matching with Wildcards

## Description:
Implement wildcard pattern matching where:
- '?' matches any single character
- '*' matches any sequence of characters (including empty sequence)

### Input:
* A string `s` and a pattern `p` containing wildcards

### Output:
* Boolean indicating if pattern matches entire string

### Examples:
* Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"  
  Output: true  
  Explanation: The first '*' matches empty, 'a' matches 'a', '*' matches 'dce', 'b' matches 'b'

* Input: s = "acdcb", p = "a*c?b"  
  Output: false  
  Explanation: '?' cannot match 'd' and 'c' simultaneously

* Input: s = "", p = "*"  
  Output: true  
  Explanation: '*' matches empty sequence

```

## Time Complexity:
* Without memoization: O(2^(m+n)) [Exponential]
* With memoization: O(mÃn) [Quadratic]

## Space Complexity:
* O(mÃn) for memoization table

## Algorithm:
1. **Base Cases**:
   - Both strings empty â true
   - Pattern empty but string remains â false

2. **Star ('*') Handling**:
   - Match empty sequence (skip star)
   - OR match current character and keep star

3. **Question Mark/Character Match**:
   - '?' matches any single character
   - Literal characters must match exactly

4. **Memoization**:
   - Stores results of (sIndex, pIndex) pairs
   - Avoids recomputing same subproblems

## Edge Cases Handled:
1. Multiple consecutive stars ("**" equivalent to "*")
2. Star at beginning/end of pattern
3. Empty string with various patterns
4. Partial matches vs complete matches

## Optimization Notes:
1. The solution can be further optimized to O(n) space using DP table compression
2. Early termination possible when remaining pattern is all stars
3. Greedy approach exists for special cases


# Wildcard Matching

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - String Matching

## Description:
Determine if a string matches a pattern with wildcard characters. The pattern can include:
* '?' - Matches any single character
* '*' - Matches any sequence of characters (including empty sequence)

### Input:
* A string s
* A pattern p containing wildcard characters

### Output:
* Boolean value - true if s matches p, false otherwise

### Examples:
* Input: s = "aa", p = "a"  
  Output: false  
  Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".

* Input: s = "aa", p = "*"  
  Output: true  
  Explanation: '*' matches any sequence, including "aa".

* Input: s = "cb", p = "?a"  
  Output: false  
  Explanation: '?' matches 'c', but 'a' does not match 'b'.

* Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"  
  Output: true  
  Explanation: The '*' matches the empty sequence in the beginning, then 'a' matches actual 'a', second '*' matches "dce", and 'b' matches 'b'.

```

## Time Complexity:
* O(2^(m+n)) - Where m is the length of the string and n is the length of the pattern. In the worst case, each '*' in the pattern could represent either empty or non-empty sequences, leading to exponential complexity.

## Space Complexity:
* O(m+n) - The space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack, which is at most m+n.

## Algorithm:
* Base cases:
  * If both string and pattern are exhausted, return true
  * If pattern is exhausted but string isn't, return false
  * If string is exhausted, check if remaining pattern consists only of '*' characters
* If current characters match or pattern has '?':
  * Move to the next character in both string and pattern
* If pattern has '*':
  * Consider two cases:
    * '*' matches empty sequence - skip '*' and continue with the pattern
    * '*' matches the current character - use '*' again for the next character
* If none of the above conditions are met, return false
* Return the final result

# Minimum Insertions to Make a String Palindrome

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - Palindrome Variation

## Description:
Find the minimum number of insertions required to make a string a palindrome. Insertions can be done at any position in the string.

### Input:
* A single string s

### Output:
* An integer representing the minimum number of insertions needed

### Examples:
* Input: s = "zzazz"  
  Output: 0  
  Explanation: The string is already a palindrome.

* Input: s = "mbadm"  
  Output: 2  
  Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm" with 2 insertions.

* Input: s = "leetcode"  
  Output: 5  
  Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".

            return 2;
        }

        System.out.println("Insertions needed: " + minInsertions(s3));  // Expected: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
* O(2^n) - Where n is the length of the string. This is because in the worst case we make two recursive calls at each step.

## Space Complexity:
* O(n) - The space used by the recursion stack, which can go up to n levels deep.

## Algorithm:
1. The minimum insertions needed equals the string length minus the length of its longest palindromic subsequence (LPS)
2. To find LPS recursively:
   - Base case 1: Single character is a palindrome of length 1
   - Base case 2: Two same characters form a palindrome of length 2
   - If first and last characters match:
     * Add 2 to result and recurse on inner substring
   - If first and last characters don't match:
     * Take maximum of LPS from excluding first or last character
3. Return string length minus LPS length

  Output: 4

   - Empty string counts as 0
2. If first and last characters match:
   - Add 1 (for the new palindrome formed by these two characters)
   - Add count from substring excluding first character
   - Add count from substring excluding last character
3. If first and last characters don't match:
   - Add counts from both substrings excluding first or last character
   - Subtract the overlap (count from substring excluding both first and last characters)

* O(m+n) - Maximum recursion depth

## Algorithm:
1. Base cases:
   - If one string is empty, return length of other
2. If last characters match:
   - Count 1 for the matching character
   - Recurse for remaining strings
3. If last characters don't match:
   - Count 1 for either character
   - Take minimum of two possibilities:
     a) Include last character of str1
     b) Include last character of str2


# Number of Ways to Decode a String (Complete Solution)

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - Recursion with Memoization

## Description:
Count the number of ways to decode a digit string where:
- 'A' â "1", 'B' â "2", ..., 'Z' â "26"
- Leading zeros are invalid ("06" can't be decoded as "F")
- Single digits (1-9) and valid double digits (10-26) are allowed

### Input:
* A string s containing only digits (0-9)

### Output:
* Integer representing number of valid decodings

### Examples:
* Input: "12" â Output: 2 ("AB" or "L")
* Input: "226" â Output: 3 ("BZ", "VF", or "BBF")
* Input: "0" â Output: 0 (invalid)
* Input: "2101" â Output: 1 ("BA A" only)
* Input: "100" â Output: 0 (no valid decoding)

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class DecodeWays {
    private static Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public static int numDecodings(String s) {
        return recursiveWithMemo(s, 0);
    }

    private static int recursiveWithMemo(String s, int index) {
        // Check memoization cache
        if (memo.containsKey(index)) {
            return memo.get(index);
        }

        // Base case: valid path
        if (index == s.length()) {
            return 1;
        }

        // Invalid: leading zero
        if (s.charAt(index) == '0') {
            return 0;
        }

        // Single digit case
        int ways = recursiveWithMemo(s, index + 1);

        // Check two-digit possibility
        if (index < s.length() - 1) {
            int twoDigit = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(index, index + 2));
            if (twoDigit >= 10 && twoDigit <= 26) {
                ways += recursiveWithMemo(s, index + 2);
            }
        }

        // Store result in memo before returning
        memo.put(index, ways);
        return ways;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] testCases = {
            "12",    // 2
            "226",   // 3
            "0",     // 0
            "06",    // 0
            "2101",  // 1
            "100",   // 0
            "11106"  // 2
        };

        for (String test : testCases) {
            memo.clear(); // Reset memo for each test case
            System.out.printf("Input: \"%s\" â Output: %d%n", 
                test, numDecodings(test));
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
* Without memoization: O(2^n) [Exponential]
* With memoization: O(n) [Linear]

## Space Complexity:
* O(n) for recursion stack and memoization storage

## Key Optimizations:
1. **Memoization Cache** (Top-down DP):
   - Stores computed results for indexes to avoid redundant calculations
   - Dramatically reduces time complexity from exponential to linear

2. **Early Termination**:
   - Immediately returns 0 for invalid cases (leading zeros)
   - Prevents unnecessary recursive calls

3. **Two-digit Validation**:
   - Only attempts two-digit interpretation for values 10-26
   - Automatically handles edge cases like "27"-"99"

## Edge Cases Handled:
1. Strings with leading zeros ("0", "06")
2. Strings ending with zero ("10" valid, "20" valid, but "30" invalid)
3. Consecutive zeros ("100")
4. Strings with all valid digits ("1234")
5. Maximum length strings (performance test)

## Alternative Solutions:
1. **Bottom-up DP** (O(n) time, O(1) space):
```java
public static int numDecodingsDP(String s) {
    if (s.charAt(0) == '0') return 0;
    
    int n = s.length();
    int prev1 = 1, prev2 = 1;
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int current = 0;
        if (s.charAt(i) != '0') {
            current = prev1;
        }
        
        int twoDigit = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(i-1, i+1));
        if (twoDigit >= 10 && twoDigit <= 26) {
            current += prev2;
        }
        
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = current;
    }
    
    return prev1;
}
```

2. **Iterative with Array** (More readable DP):
```java
public static int numDecodingsArray(String s) {
    int[] dp = new int[s.length() + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = s.charAt(0) == '0' ? 0 : 1;
    
    for (int i = 2; i <= s.length(); i++) {
        int oneDigit = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(i-1, i));
        int twoDigits = Integer.parseInt(s.substring(i-2, i));
        
        if (oneDigit >= 1) {
            dp[i] += dp[i-1];
        }
        if (twoDigits >= 10 && twoDigits <= 26) {
            dp[i] += dp[i-2];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[s.length()];
}
```

1. Add more test cases?
2. Explain the DP solutions in more detail?
3. Provide solutions for any other problems from your original list?

# Regular Expression Matching

## Pattern:
Dynamic Programming - String Matching with Regex

## Description:
Implement regular expression matching where:
- '.' matches any single character
- '*' matches zero or more of the preceding element

### Input:
* A string `s` and a pattern `p` containing regex special characters

### Output:
* Boolean indicating if pattern matches entire string

### Examples:
* Input: s = "aa", p = "a"  
  Output: false  
  Explanation: "a" doesn't match entire string "aa"

* Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"  
  Output: true  
  Explanation: '*' matches zero or more 'a's

* Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"  
  Output: true  
  Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)"

```java
public class RegexMatching {
    private static Boolean[][] memo;

    public static boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        memo = new Boolean[s.length()+1][p.length()+1];
        return matchHelper(s, p, 0, 0);
    }

    private static boolean matchHelper(String s, String p, int sIdx, int pIdx) {
        // Check memoization
        if (memo[sIdx][pIdx] != null) {
            return memo[sIdx][pIdx];
        }

        // Base case: both pattern and string exhausted
        if (pIdx == p.length()) {
            return sIdx == s.length();
        }

        // Check current character match
        boolean firstMatch = (sIdx < s.length()) && 
                           (p.charAt(pIdx) == '.' || p.charAt(pIdx) == s.charAt(sIdx));

        // Handle Kleene star case
        if (pIdx + 1 < p.length() && p.charAt(pIdx + 1) == '*') {
            // Case 1: don't use the star (match zero characters)
            boolean zeroMatch = matchHelper(s, p, sIdx, pIdx + 2);
            
            // Case 2: use the star if first character matches
            boolean starMatch = firstMatch && matchHelper(s, p, sIdx + 1, pIdx);
            
            return memo[sIdx][pIdx] = zeroMatch || starMatch;
        }

        // Simple match case
        return memo[sIdx][pIdx] = firstMatch && matchHelper(s, p, sIdx + 1, pIdx + 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[][] testCases = {
            {"aa", "a"},    // false
            {"aa", "a*"},   // true
            {"ab", ".*"},   // true
            {"aab", "c*a*b"}, // true
            {"mississippi", "mis*is*p*."} // false
        };

        for (String[] test : testCases) {
            memo = new Boolean[test[0].length()+1][test[1].length()+1];
            System.out.printf("Input: s=\"%s\", p=\"%s\" â %b%n",
                test[0], test[1], isMatch(test[0], test[1]));
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
* Without memoization: O(2^(m+n)) [Exponential]
* With memoization: O(mÃn) [Quadratic]

## Space Complexity:
* O(mÃn) for memoization table

## Key Differences from Wildcard Matching:
1. Star ('*') behavior:
   - In regex: matches zero or more of preceding element
   - In wildcard: matches any sequence

2. Dot ('.') vs question mark ('?'):
   - '.' matches exactly one character
   - '?' matches zero or one character

## Algorithm Breakdown:
1. **Base Case**:
   - Pattern exhausted â check if string also exhausted

2. **Star Handling**:
   - Option 1: Skip star and its preceding character (match zero)
   - Option 2: Consume current character if it matches star's preceding element

3. **Simple Match**:
   - Current characters must match (either exact or via '.')
   - Proceed to next characters in both strings

## Optimization Notes:
1. The DP table can be compressed to O(n) space
2. Patterns can be preprocessed to merge consecutive stars
3. Early termination possible when remaining pattern cannot possibly match remaining string
