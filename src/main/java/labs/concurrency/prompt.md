- **Refined prompt**
Hereâ€™s a **generic template** that can be adapted for **any Java Concurrency & Exception Handling** learning assignment.
This **template** is **flexible** and can be applied to **any concurrency-based Java project** while ensuring a structured and in-depth learning experience.
### **Java Concurrency & Exception Handling Assignment: [Project Title]**

#### **Objective:**
Develop a **step-by-step assignment** to guide students in mastering **Java Concurrency** and **Exception Handling** by building a **[Project Name]**.  
 The assignment should be **comprehensive**, with exercises that progressively introduce core concepts while ensuring practical implementation.

#### **Guidelines:**
- The central problem should focus on **[Project Domain]** (e.g., Order Processing, Banking Transactions, Task Scheduling).
- Follow a **structured, step-by-step approach** to introduce key **Concurrency & Exception Handling** concepts.
- Ensure **each exercise builds upon previous steps** for a smooth learning curve.

#### **Topics to Cover:**

### 1. **Thread Synchronization**
   - **`synchronized` keyword** (method-level, block-level)
   - **Intrinsic Locks (Monitor locks)**
   - **Reentrant Locks (`ReentrantLock`)**

### 2. **Inter-Thread Communication**
   - **`wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()`** (Object class methods)
   - **`join()`** (Waiting for a thread to finish)
   - **`yield()` & `sleep()`** (Pausing thread execution)

### 3. **Java Memory Model (JMM)**
   - **Visibility & Atomicity issues**
   - **Happens-before relationships**
   - **Volatile keyword (`volatile` ensures visibility but not atomicity)**

### 4. **Exception Handling in Multithreading**
   - **Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions**
   - **Handling exceptions in concurrent execution (`try-catch`, logging, rethrowing)**
   - **Handling exceptions in Executors (`ThreadPoolExecutor`, `Future.get()`)**

---

### **For Each Step, Provide:**

1. **Detailed Class Structure & Method Signatures**
   - Define **class names, method signatures, and intended behavior**.
   - Specify **parameters, return types, and contracts** for each method.

2. **Expected Input & Output**
   - Clearly describe **input data and expected results** for each step.

3. **Local Execution Only**
   - **No network I/O calls.** All data should be generated or provided within the application.

4. **Comprehensive Technical Details**
   - Explain **design choices, concurrency techniques, and exception-handling mechanisms** used in each step.
   - Highlight the importance of each concept in **real-world applications**.

5. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
   - Ensure each step **progressively builds upon the previous ones**, enhancing understanding.
   - Include **as many steps as necessary** to ensure a **thorough** learning experience.

Can you build a cheat sheet for the same , this cheat sheet should cover all the important concepts we have covered till now
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Include comprehensive exercises covering the following topics:**

- **Executor Framework**: Implement examples using `FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool`, `ScheduledThreadPool`, and `WorkStealingPool`.
- **Futures and CompletableFuture**: Demonstrate asynchronous programming with proper handling of results and exceptions.
- **Error Handling in Concurrent Applications**: Cover handling of `ExecutionException`, `InterruptedException`, and proper shutdown of executors.
- **ThreadLocal and InheritableThreadLocal**: Include at least one assignment focusing on scenarios where these are necessary.
- **Latches, Barriers & Semaphores**:
  - **CountDownLatch**: Waiting for multiple threads.
  - **CyclicBarrier**: Synchronizing multiple threads.
  - **Semaphore**: Controlling thread access.
  - **Building a real-world caching solution using concurrency techniques** (one of the later assignments should involve designing a thread-safe caching mechanism, possibly using `ConcurrentHashMap` and `ReadWriteLock`)

---


Each module should include:
   * **Problem Statement**
   * **Detailed Requirements**
   * **Expected Outcome**
   * **Hints or Guidance on Relevant APIs (**`ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture`, `ThreadLocal`, etc.)
   * **Edge cases and best practices to follow**
Generate the full **assignment plan with module details and sample problem statements**.

#####################  

3. **Steps 1-3** should cover fundamental concurrency concepts, including:
