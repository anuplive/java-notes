Here’s a comprehensive list of Java programming problems related to **Queue and Stack** that are frequently asked by top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and others. These problems are organized by difficulty level (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and cover a wide range of scenarios to help you prepare for real-world interviews.

## **Basic Problems**
These problems focus on fundamental concepts of stacks and queues and are ideal for beginners.

1. **Implement Stack using Arrays**
   - Implement a stack data structure using arrays with push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations.

2. **Implement Queue using Arrays**
   - Implement a queue data structure using arrays with enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty operations.

3. **Valid Parentheses**
   - Given a string containing just the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]`, determine if the input string is valid. The brackets must close in the correct order.
   - Example: `()[]{}` is valid, but `([)]` is not.

4. **Reverse a String using Stack**
   - Reverse a given string using a stack data structure.

5. **Implement Stack using Queues**
   - Implement a stack using only queues (either one or two queues).

6. **Implement Queue using Stacks**
   - Implement a queue using only stacks (either one or two stacks).

7. **Minimum Element in Stack**
   - Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

## **Intermediate Problems**
These problems require a deeper understanding of stacks and queues and involve more complex logic.

8. **Next Greater Element**
   - Given an array, find the next greater element for each element in the array. If no greater element exists, return -1.
   - Example: Input: `[4, 5, 2, 25]`, Output: `[5, 25, 25, -1]`.

9. **Stock Span Problem**
   - Calculate the span of stock prices for each day where the span is the maximum number of consecutive days (before the current day) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the current price.
   - Example: Input: `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, Output: `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.

10. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram**
    - Given an array of integers representing the heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the histogram.
    - Example: Input: `[2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]`, Output: `10`.

11. **Sliding Window Maximum**
    - Given an array and an integer `k`, find the maximum element in each sliding window of size `k`.
    - Example: Input: `[1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]`, `k = 3`, Output: `[3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]`.

12. **Circular Queue Implementation**
    - Implement a circular queue using arrays with enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty operations.

13. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**
    - Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation (postfix notation).
    - Example: Input: `["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]`, Output: `9`.

14. **Decode String**
    - Given an encoded string, return its decoded string. The encoding rule is `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is repeated exactly `k` times.
    - Example: Input: `3[a2[c]]`, Output: `accaccacc`.

## **Advanced Problems**
These problems are complex and require a strong understanding of stacks, queues, and their applications in algorithms.

15. **Design a Max Stack**
    - Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the maximum element in constant time.

16. **Minimum Number of Brackets Reversal**
    - Given an expression with only `{` and `}`, find the minimum number of bracket reversals needed to make the expression balanced.
    - Example: Input: `}{{}}{{{`, Output: `3`.

17. **Longest Valid Parentheses**
    - Given a string containing just the characters `(` and `)`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.
    - Example: Input: `(()`, Output: `2`.

18. **Remove K Digits**
    - Given a non-negative integer represented as a string and an integer `k`, remove `k` digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
    - Example: Input: `"1432219"`, `k = 3`, Output: `"1219"`.

19. **Flatten Nested List Iterator**
    - Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.
    - Example: Input: `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`, Output: `[1,1,2,1,1]`.

20. **Design Hit Counter**
    - Design a hit counter that counts the number of hits in the past 5 minutes (300 seconds). It should support `hit()` and `getHits()` operations.

21. **Trapping Rain Water**
    - Given an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
    - Example: Input: `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`, Output: `6`.

22. **Maximum Frequency Stack**
    - Design a stack-like data structure that supports push, pop, and retrieving the most frequent element. If there is a tie, return the element closest to the top.

23. **Simplify Path**
    - Given an absolute path for a file or directory, simplify it.
    - Example: Input: `"/a/./b/../../c/"`, Output: `"/c"`.

24. **Basic Calculator**
    - Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string containing non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `(`, and `)`.
    - Example: Input: `"(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"`, Output: `23`.

25. **Asteroid Collision**
    - Given an array of integers representing asteroids in a row, simulate their collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one explodes. If both are the same size, both explode.
    - Example: Input: `[5, 10, -5]`, Output: `[5, 10]`.

## **Tips for Solving These Problems**
1. **Understand the Basics**: Ensure you are comfortable with the core operations of stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO).
2. **Use Built-in Classes**: In Java, use `Stack`, `Deque`, or `LinkedList` for implementing stacks and queues.
3. **Optimize for Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases like empty stacks/queues, invalid inputs, or large datasets.
4. **Practice Time and Space Complexity**: Be prepared to discuss the time and space complexity of your solutions.
